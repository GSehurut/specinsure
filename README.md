This is going to be my simple attempt to create a specialty reinsurance python package.

A simple Python toolkit for simulating and analyzing reinsurance structures in the London Specialty Insurance Market.

This package is aimed at actuaries, analysts, and technical insurance professionals who want to explore how reinsurance programs like Excess-of-Loss (XoL) treaties impact loss portfolios using Monte Carlo methods.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Simulate large loss distributions using lognormal or other distributions
- Model basic per-occurrence reinsurance like:
  - Excess-of-Loss (XoL)
  - Quota Share (coming soon)
- Visualize loss distributions and reinsurance recoveries
- Estimate key risk metrics like:
  - Mean loss
  - Value-at-Risk (VaR)
  - Tail Value-at-Risk (TVaR)
